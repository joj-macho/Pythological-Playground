Variables can store different data types and it's important to choose descriptive variable names. Here are some examples of how to set variables in Python."

    "### Naming Variables and Identifiers\n",
    "<p>When it comes to naming your variables and identifiers in Python, there are some rules you need to follow to avoid errors and confusion. Here are some of the most important rules:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Variable names should only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>\n",
    "<li>They should start with a letter or an underscore, but never with a number.</li>\n",
    "<li>Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but you can use underscores to separate words in variable names.</li>\n",
    "<li>Variable names should not include special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc.</li>\n",
    "<li>Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names. For example, don't use the word \"print\" as a variable name.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Following these rules will help you avoid errors and make your code easier to read. But there are also some standard naming conventions that are widely used in the Python community:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Use lowercase letters for variable names.</li>\n",
    "<li>Use underscores to separate words in variable names, rather than spaces.</li>\n",
    "<li>Use all caps for constant values, such as PI or MAX_VALUE.</li>\n",
    "<li>Use CamelCase for class names.</li>\n",

    "## Data Types in Python\n",
    "<p>Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold values of different types. Understanding the different data types in Python is crucial for effectively working with variables and expressions. Some common data types in Python include:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Numeric types: Integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), and complex numbers (complex).</li>\n",
    "<li>Boolean type: Represents the truth values True and False.</li>\n",
    "<li>Strings: Sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (\"\").</li>\n",
    "<li>Lists: Ordered collections of items, enclosed in square brackets ([]).</li>\n",
    "<li>Tuples: Similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be modified), enclosed in parentheses ().</li>\n",
    "<li>Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces ({}) with each pair separated by a colon (:).</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Here are examples that provide a comprehensive overview of different data types in Python and demonstrate their usage with variables.</p>"
