# Matrix Stream

## Description

The Matrix Stream program simulates the falling green code from the "Matrix" movies.

## How it Works

- The program continuously updates and prints the state of a digit stream, creating the visual effect of the Matrix code rain.
- It uses randomization to vary the stream length, and value of each stream.

## Running the Program

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd matrix-stream/

# Run the main script
python3 matrix_stream.py
```

## Program Output

When you run `matrix_stream.py`, the output will look like this;
