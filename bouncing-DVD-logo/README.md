# Bouncing DVD Logo Animation

## Description

The Bouncing DVD Logo Animation program simulates a classic "bouncing DVD logo" animation in a terminal.

Check out the [Pygame Playground](https://github.com/joj-macho/Pygame-Playground) repo for more animations.

## How it Works

- The program animates one or more "DVD" logos moving within a defined rectangular area.
- When the logos hit the borders or corners, they change direction and color.
- The program also tracks the logo's number of bounces, and corner bounces for each logo.

## Running the Program

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd bouncing-DVD-logo/

# Run the main script
python3 bouncing_dvd.py
```

## Program Input & Output

When you run `bouncing_dvd.py`, the output will look like this:
