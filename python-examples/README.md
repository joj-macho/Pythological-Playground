# Python Examples

Welcome to this repository containing IPython notebooks with Python examples covering various topics! This repository is perfect for those who want to learn Python from scratch or brush up on their Python skills. The notebooks in this repository are organized into several IPython Notebooks, each covering a specific topic in Python.

## Notebook Examples

- The [**py_basics**](py_basics.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover the basics of Python programming, such as variables, data types, and operators. If you're new to Python, these notebooks are a great place to start.

- The [**py_lists_tuples**](py_lists_tuples.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover lists and tuples in Python, which are important data structures for storing and manipulating data.

- The [**py_strings**](py_strings.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover strings in Python, which are used to represent text data.

- The [**py_sets**](py_sets.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover sets in Python, which are used to represent collections of unique elements.

- The [**py_numbers**](py_numbers.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover numbers in Python, which are used for arithmetic operations and calculations.

- The [**py_functions**](py_functions.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover functions in Python, which are used to organize code and make it reusable.

- The [**py_file**](py_file.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover file handling in Python, which is an essential skill for working with data.

- The [**py_while_loops**](py_while_loops.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover loops in Python, which are used to iterate over collections of data.

- The [**py_for_loops**](py_for_loops.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover loops in Python, which are used to iterate over collections of data.

- The [**py_conditions**](py_conditions.ipynb) notebook contains notebooks that cover conditions in Python, which are used to control the flow of code based on certain conditions.

I hope you find these notebooks helpful in your journey to becoming a Python programmer!
